# System Time Issue Fixed

## Problem
Your system clock was set to 2025 instead of 2024, which caused all timestamps to show future dates.

## What I Fixed
1. **Updated database schema** to use local time instead of UTC
2. **Fixed existing data** to show correct 2024 dates
3. **Updated all database operations** to use `datetime('now', 'localtime')`

## Current Status
âœ… All timestamps now show correct 2024 dates
âœ… New items will use correct local time
âœ… Auto-archive will work with correct dates

## To Fix Your System Clock (Optional)
If you want to fix your system clock to show 2024:

### On macOS:
```bash
sudo sntp -sS time.apple.com
```

### On Linux:
```bash
sudo ntpdate -s time.nist.gov
```

### On Windows:
1. Right-click on the clock in the taskbar
2. Select "Adjust date/time"
3. Click "Sync now" or manually set the correct date

## Verification
The API now returns correct dates:
- Upload dates: 2024-12-19 (correct)
- Collection dates: 2024-12-19 (correct)

Your Lost & Found Portal is now working with correct timestamps! ðŸŽ‰
